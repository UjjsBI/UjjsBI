👋 Hi, I’m Ujjwala (UjjsBI)

🚀 Data Scientist | GenAI & ML Specialist | Full-Stack & QA Automation Engineer

I’m passionate about turning complex data and business problems into intelligent, automated solutions using AI, ML, and software engineering. With hands-on experience spanning data science, full-stack development, and test automation, I love building systems that are not only innovative but also reliable, scalable, and production-ready.

🔍 About Me

👀 Interests: Generative AI (GenAI), RAG pipelines, Data Science, Time-Series Forecasting, Process Automation, Full-Stack Development, and QA Frameworks

🌱 Currently Learning: Advanced LLM integration (LangChain, Qdrant), deployment pipelines with Docker + AWS, and frontend UX enhancements with React/Streamlit

💻 Experience & Highlights:

🔹 Built domain-specific RAG pipelines using LangChain + Qdrant, integrating embedding-based retrieval, query normalization, and similarity ranking with BAAI/bge-base-en

🔹 Developed Streamlit apps for ML projects, enabling interactive insights for cancer prediction, IMDb rating prediction, and healthcare chatbots

🔹 Designed time-series forecasting models to analyze and predict trends across domains (e.g., energy efficiency, salary prediction, student performance)

🔹 Automated QA processes: Built regression frameworks (Selenium, Appium, Katalon) and applied AI-driven testing logic, reducing test cycles by 50% and boosting early defect detection

🔹 Delivered end-to-end process automation with FastAPI microservices, integrating AWS Textract for document OCR and preprocessing pipelines

🔹 Applied EDA & ML modeling on structured and unstructured datasets, extracting insights and building predictive models across domains
